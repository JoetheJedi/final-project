# Instructions for Running my Project

Hey classmates and anyone else trying out my program. First things first, a quick discription of the program.
It will give you a list of three genres and you will have to type the name of the genre from the list you enjoy the most.
From there depending on the genre you chose, my program will show you a list of games that fit within that genre that you might like. Once you see a game you might like type the Letter choice before the game to view a trailer from the game.

In order for my program to open up a trailer for the game the user needs to have firefox installed on their computer.
You can download Firefox here https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/
Once thats done you'll need in import the selenium module into you python. 
You can do that by following the directions on this page https://automatetheboringstuff.com/appendixa/.
The selenium module is the only one you need.
and thats it! You should be set up to try the program if you followed the steps above
